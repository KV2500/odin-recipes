        <h1>Samosa</h1>

            <h2>Description:</h2>
            Samosas are deep-fried, triangular pastries filled with a spiced mixture of potatoes, 
            peas, and sometimes meat. They have a crispy, 
            golden-brown exterior and are often served with chutneys for extra flavor.
            </p>
            <p>
            If samosas were a data structure, they’d be a stack—layers of crispy goodness stacked on top of a spicy, 
            well-structured filling. You pop one, and just like a recursive function, you find yourself calling another.
            Their triangular shape is basically a pointer to happiness, directing taste buds straight to satisfaction. 
            The outer crust? A perfectly compiled shield, encapsulating a rich core of mashed potatoes, peas, 
            and a mix of Indian spices that run a tight algorithm of flavors. 
            And don’t even get me started on the chutneys—they’re like APIs that enhance the whole experience, 
            making every bite an integration of sweet, spicy, and tangy notes. Debugging hunger with samosas? 
            Always a successful execution.
